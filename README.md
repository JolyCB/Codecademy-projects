My projects accomplished on Codecademy trainings
The Portfolio Optimization project is my very first Python project for financial analysis. It aims to find the optimal portfolio of 4 selected stocks: JPM, GOOG, UL and JNJ
and demonstrate an Efficient Frontier to show risks-returns relationship of 10k random portfolios of 4 stocks.
